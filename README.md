Purpose and Use of the App:
The app is a character creation tool for a role-playing game (RPG). Users can create and customize their own characters by selecting a name, race, class, and distributing stat points. The app provides an intuitive interface with options to choose from for race and class, as well as buttons to increase or decrease each stat individually.

Once a character is created, it can be saved locally on the device. Users can then view a list of all saved characters, which displays their name, race, and class. They can also select a character from the list to view more details about that character.

Overall, the app provides a convenient way for RPG enthusiasts to create and manage their own custom characters for use in their games.
